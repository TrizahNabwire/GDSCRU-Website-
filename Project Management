#      Lean & Six Sigma methodology.
##### Goals : Improve quality and move through processes quickly.
## Use DMAIC strategy
#### That is, Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC)
### 1) Define the project goal
### 2) Measure how the current process is performing
### 3) Analyze by identifying gaps and issues
### 4) Improve by presenting findings and getting ready to start making improvements
### 5) Control ; learning from the work did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so that we don't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things.
