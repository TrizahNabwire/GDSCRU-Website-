## Be concise

To facilitate navigation and discovery, write UI text in short, scannable segments that focus on a limited number of concepts at a time.

To facilitate navigation and discovery, write UI text in short, scannable segments that focus on a limited number of concepts at a time.

## Address users clearly

Address users in either the second person (you or your) or the first person (I, me, or my), depending on which is suitable and clearest for the situation.

Each form of address is recommended for the following contexts:

Second person, "you" or "your": This conversational style is appropriate in most situations; as though the UI is speaking directly to the user.
First person, "I" or "my": In some cases, this form of address emphasizes the user's ownership of content or actions.

### Do
Speak directly to the user in the second person.
#### Quickly open the camera without unlocking your screen

Emphasize ownership of actions using the first person.
#### I agree to follow the terms of service

### Do
Speak directly to the user in the second person.
#### Your places

### Do
Emphasize content ownership using the first person.
#### My Account


## Avoid combining first and second person
To avoid confusing the user, avoid using "me" or "my," and "you" or "your," in the same phrase.


### Don't
Don't refer to the user in both the second person and the first person within the same phrase.
#### Change your preferences in My Account

## Communicate essential details

Communicate only essential details so users can focus on their own tasks. Sometimes the most effective UI contains no text at all.

write in the past or future tenses, use simple verb forms.

### Do
Write in the present tense.
#### Message sent

### Don't
Don't write in different variations of the present tense, such as the present perfect tense.
