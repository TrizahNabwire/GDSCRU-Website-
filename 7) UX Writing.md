## Address users clearly

Address users in either the second person (you or your) or the first person (I, me, or my), depending on which is suitable and clearest for the situation.

Each form of address is recommended for the following contexts:

Second person, "you" or "your": This conversational style is appropriate in most situations; as though the UI is speaking directly to the user.
First person, "I" or "my": In some cases, this form of address emphasizes the user's ownership of content or actions.

Speak directly to the user in the second person.

### Don't
Don't refer to the user in both the second person and the first person within the same phrase.
