# Empathize


## UX Research

#### Qualitative research - I interviewed both active and passive members of GDSCRU.
I focused on what users need to be done different to the current site and from interviewing them on their experiences, thoughts, opinions and feelings towards it,
I got to pinpoint some of the pain points. After interviewing members indivually,
I went ahead and interviewed different focus groups to study their reactions and realised they had the same pain points as the interviewed individually participants.
