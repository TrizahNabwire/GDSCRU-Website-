## Ideas
#### Provide Google Codelabs then other resources in different groups(Priorise Google technologies because this is a Google program, but still different individuals are passionate in different tech fields, they also need learning resources from the club)

#### Photos can be accessed from past events only, You can expect photos upcoming events

#### Besides, photos section in a past event, presentation slides would be effective being alongside it

#### Authenticate to find out if the user is a member or a mentor who will contribute to the growth of the club.
